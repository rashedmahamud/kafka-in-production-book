# Chapter 5: Producers and Consumers in the Real World

Kafka’s power comes from its producers and consumers. Proper tuning and understanding of their behavior is key to performance and reliability.

## Throughput Tuning, Batching, and Retries

- Producers should batch messages to improve throughput.
- Use `linger.ms` and `batch.size` configs to balance latency vs throughput.
- Enable retries with backoff to handle transient errors gracefully.
- Beware of infinite retries that can cause message pile-up.

## Idempotence and Delivery Semantics

- Enable **idempotent producers** to avoid duplicate messages on retries.
- Understand Kafka’s delivery guarantees:
  - **At most once**: Fast but can lose messages.
  - **At least once**: Default mode, may cause duplicates.
  - **Exactly once**: Requires idempotent producers and transaction support.

## Consumer Groups, Rebalancing, and Lag

- Consumers in a group share partitions for parallel processing.
- Rebalancing happens when consumers join/leave, causing temporary downtime.
- Monitor consumer lag closely to detect slow consumers or bottlenecks.
- Tune session and heartbeat intervals to balance quick failure detection vs false positives.

Mastering producers and consumers ensures your data flows efficiently and correctly.
