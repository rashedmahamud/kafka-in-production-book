# Chapter 1: Introduction – Why Kafka in Production?

Welcome to *Kafka in Production*, a practical guide based on real-world experience running Apache Kafka clusters at scale.

## Why I Wrote This Book

Kafka is one of the most powerful event streaming platforms available today. It enables decoupled, resilient, and scalable data pipelines that power modern distributed systems. But running Kafka **in production** is a different beast than just getting it up and running in a test environment.  

This book captures lessons learned from the trenches — the successes, the pitfalls, and the hard-earned wisdom — to help you avoid common mistakes and run Kafka reliably in your environment.

## Who This Book Is For

This book is written for engineers and teams who:

- Build and operate Kafka clusters in production
- Design event-driven architectures
- Need to ensure high availability, durability, and scalability
- Are looking for practical advice beyond the official docs and tutorials

Whether you are a backend engineer, platform team member, or data engineer, this book will give you actionable insights to improve your Kafka deployment.

## What Kafka Solves

Kafka is often described as a distributed commit log or event streaming platform. Its core strengths include:

- **Decoupling** producers and consumers for asynchronous, resilient data flow
- **Durability and reliability** through replicated partitions and log retention
- **Scalability** across clusters with topic partitioning
- **Real-time processing** for modern data pipelines

In practice, Kafka enables use cases like log aggregation, event sourcing, real-time analytics, and microservice communication.

## What You’ll Learn

By the end of this book, you’ll be able to:

- Plan and deploy Kafka clusters suited for your workload and infrastructure
- Tune producers and consumers for performance and correctness
- Monitor Kafka health with the right metrics and alerts
- Handle security, schema evolution, and integration challenges
- Diagnose and recover from outages and failures
- Scale Kafka clusters effectively while minimizing risks

Let’s dive in and explore how to bring Kafka into production — the right way.
